    <h3> <strong> - Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people </strong></h3>

        <p> 
            Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to adapt and rewire according to our thoughts and actions. It is the process by which we learn new things. This happens when new connections are formed between our existing neurons. There are two types of neuroplasticity: Structural and functional. Structural neuroplasticity is the change in strength between neurons or synapses, and functional neuroplasticity describes the permanent changes in synapses from learning and development. Increased understanding in Neuroplasticity can greatly benefit learning, enhance cognitive abilities, creativity, memory functions, recovery from strokes and brain damage, and many other benefits.

    <h3> <strong> - Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</strong></h3>

        <p>
            I am going to rewire my existing thought patterns to change the way I think and approach things. One of of doing that is self-reflection, journaling, meditation, and being aware of my own critical voice. By acquiring new habits of positive outlook and self-image, I can actively shape my own learning and growth. 

        </p>

    <h3> <strong> - What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</strong></h3>
    
         <p>
            Memory training, writing with the non-dominant hand, dancing, creating artwork, good sleep hygiene, reading fiction and increasing vocabulary are all great ways to increase neuroplasticity.

        <h3> <strong> - Discuss what it is and why it is relevant </strong></h3>
            <p>
                Growth mindset is the mentality that one’s abilities can be improved through effort, persistence, and good teaching. Everyone has varying degrees in regards to different abilities but anyone can improve their competency through work and perseverance. 
                Fixed mindset is the opposite where people believe their abilities cannot be developed because it is all fixed or capped. It is not a constructive way of being but many people fall trap to it, including myself. 
                It is worth noting that one can have both mindsets at the same time. For example, I believed that I was a good improviser but a bad planner. 
                
            </p>

        <h3> <strong> - In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you? </strong></h3>

             <p>
                I was surprised at how growth mindset actually worked. By proving to ourselves in little ways, by racking up small wins, we can begin to actually change our brain patterns to be more conducive to our success. I believed for a long time that I would not amount to be a tech savvy person, and I simply do not have the abilities to hang in there with others in terms of academics. I have surprised myself with how much I have managed to learn in this course (there’s always much more to learn) and how much I have stuck in there, despite early challenges. 

            </p>

        <h3> <strong> - How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey? </strong></h3>
        
             <p>
                I will set out a task for myself every morning, a task which is completely doable and at the end of the day, reflect on how I went about doing the task and how it’s shaped my growth. I will do this through journaling. 

            </p>

    </div>

            <h3> <strong> - Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </strong></h3>

            <p>
                I will integrate a new routine into my learning plan, primarily journalling, and learning to write with my left (non-dominant) hand. Through reflection I will track my own personal development and reference back to how it aids my learning.
