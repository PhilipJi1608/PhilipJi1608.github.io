    <p> <strong> - An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </strong></p>

        <p> 
            Picture a live animal, like a zebra. HTML is the bone structure of the zebra, the muscles, tendons, and did I mention, the backbone of the zebra? CSS is the stripes. Stylish af! I know. Fancy lad, that one. 
            Now, obviously zebra embodies the perfect blend of beauty and the beast, which is quite alike a webpage. Without HTML, there is no text, no structure, nothing to go on. Without CSS, the zebra might be albino. Same with a webpage. It needs some stylin', or else it'll be bland af.

    <p> <strong> - Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. </strong></p>

        <p>
            So you know the the aforementioned zebra, right? Picture it running away from a evil, conniving lion (jokes, I love lions, being a Leo myself). Now, to move away as quickly and as efficiently from the hungry lion, our zebra needs to have a perfect motion. It must first use its eyes to survey the landscape for any potential obstacles and other lions, figure out a clear path, and lift up its front legs, then pushing off with back legs. Tails brislting in the wind for extra theatrics. Now, say the zebra is somehow not fit for survival, it'll just scurry off in any direction it can get a move on. It might crash onto a rock, or run into another lion waiting in ambush. Or the zebra mixes up one of the steps for perfect motion, i.e. kicking its backlegs without moving its front legs, thus running itself to the ground. 

            What does this have to do control flow and loops for Javascript, you say? Well, you see, to get it up and running, you need to program it in a way that is consequential and logical. If you tell it to put the pizza in the oven without kneading the dough first, you may find yourself a very scorched piece of ....flour.

    <p> <strong> - Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </strong></p>
    
         <p>
                DOM is how a web browser sees the code for a web page. It can be interacted (tinkered) with using DevTools in Chrome, or pressing F12. Many many things can be tinkered with to achieve maximum hilarity. Remember the zebra? It's the brain of the zebra. Sure, without it, the body can move on its own out of pure electrical impulses, but with it, the zebra becomes much, much more powerful and dynamic.

        <p> <strong> - Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </strong></p>
    
         <p>
               Arrays are basically a list of data stored together. Objects are much more sophisticated, often with functions and many different types of data stored within. You can access a single piece of information or a dozen from an object. Arrays are much simpler. 
        </p>

        <p> <strong> - Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </strong></p>
    
        Functions are set of commands created to enable us to recall and use at a later time. Let's say if I made an object that records the total number of zebras in an area, I can use a function to pull up that specific information. If I wanted to find out the number of zebras that survive from predators each year, I can also create a function that tells me about the number of surviving zebras, how many attacks occured, and how many daring escapes each zebra has made.
