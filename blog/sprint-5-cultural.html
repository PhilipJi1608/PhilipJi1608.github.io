        <h2 align="center"> <strong>Reflection: Core Learnings</strong></h2>
        
    </div>
       


    <h3> <strong> - What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></h3>
    
         <p>
            I have learned that I am harsh on myself and I need to work on giving myself credit in regards to the capacity I have for learning. I've learned that my time management will be a crucial factor in my success or lack thereof in the course. I will need to come up with better planning for the future not just for this bootcamp but in my everyday life.
        </p>


        <h3> <strong> - What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </strong></h3>
            <p>
                How integral it has been to my well-being and learning. I would appreciate more topics on how to to unlock my potential, such as the subject on neuroplasticity.
                
            </p>

        <h3> <strong> - What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </strong></h3>

             <p>
                Applying them and using them to further my learning. They are useful but need more time to be processed and put into practice.

            </p>

        <h3> <strong> - Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </strong></h3>
        
             <p>
                Because the industry needs more dynamic individuals who'd work well in group settings as well as being well-adjusted to the pressures of adapting with the ever changing tech-landscape. And also because this is an awesome philosophy of learning in general, which I am immensely grateful for! It's also a great break from the monotony of the staring at the screen in frustion.

            </p>

            <h3> <strong> - Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></h3>

             <p>
                Quite the opposite. They are my FAVOURITE topics. They've helped me grow and provided encouragement. Most valuable resources by far besides the bean bags.

            </p>
