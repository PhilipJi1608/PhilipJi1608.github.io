<h2> 
  <Strong> - What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</Strong>
</h2>

</div>

<p> 
  Inside CSS boxes are margins, borders and paddings. Picture three boxe inside the page, within its centre lies the content. Padding refers to the space around the content, border refers to the space around the padding, and margin refers to the space around the border. </p>
  
  <p>Using the CSS command <b> <em>margin</em></b>, properties of top, right, bottom, and left can be used to adjust the margins. All the margin properties have values (such as % and length) that can help specify the margin in px, pt, cm and others. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CSS <b> <em>border</em></b> command can be used to to adjust the style, width, and color of an element’s border. Different sides of the same border can even be displayed differently.
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    The CSS <b> <em>padding</em></b> command can be used to create space around an element’s content, inside any borders. The length and percentage (displayed as %) can be used to adjust any or all sides of a padding.
  </p> 
  
<p>Together, these three parts make up the CSS Box model. It is the box that wraps around any HTML element. These properties can be adjusted to create a variety of styles that would suit the content and design. </p>

<p>There are also <b>shorthand</b> commands that are used to shorten codes for these three elements. </p>
