<p> According to 16personalities.com, I am a Virtuoso Personality (ISTP, -A/-T). This means that I’m optimistic, energetic, creative in practical things, spontaneous and rational. I'm also relaxed most of the time (when I'm not stressing about deadlines). It also means that I’m easily bored, stubborn, and can come across insensitive. I don’t work well with confined rules and timelines. </p>

<p> I find these descriptions to be accurate. I highly value freedom, curiosity, and hate being tied-down by monotonous commitments. I also am (currently) terrible with time management. I get distracted easily and can get lost in the distraction for quite a while. I’m also a perfectionist and that can get detrimental for my work. I tend to start slow and get bogged down by the need to make things perfect, thus taking time away from my projects. <p>


<p> - Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>

<p> I once went to a restaurant and paid by cash upon leaving. Minutes later I discovered that I got $100 instead of $50 in change. I went back to the restaurant and returned the money. Even though I felt sorry for the restaurant staff who got an earful from her manager, ultimately I was glad that I’d made the decision. </p>

<p> The values involved with that decision were: Honesty, fairness and self-respect. Had I kept the money, it wouldn’t have made me a better person, in fact I would’ve started to resent myself for that action. The consequences were that the waitress got in trouble for not paying attention when counting money, increased self-respect for myself, and a sense of integrity.</p>

<p> - Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
<p>I was born in China but came to NZ at a very young age. I remember the feeling of not belonging anywhere, as I did not have a lot of friends and I did not speak much English. My dad(single parent) was not around due to his own issues, and I was a lonely child growing up. But that experience also shaped my unique personality. I enjoy freedom of thought, being, and action. I despise being put in a situation where monotony and lack of creative thinking is the norm. I have also acquired the ability to self-amuse and have pushed beyond my comfort zone in terms of socialising with others. Because of my harsh childhood I have extra empathy and compassion for everyone. </p>

<p> Overall, my values are compassion, empathy, freedom, curiosity, having space to think, create and grow.
</p>

<p> I consider myself a constantly-evolving being, adapting to wherever I go. This is reflected in my music preference, which is quite diverse and random. I don’t consider myself as just being Chinese or Kiwi, but rather, the sum of all of the cultural/personal influences I’ve had, plus my values, strengths, and flaws. </p>

<p> - Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </p>

<p> My limitations are: time management, focus, and self-doubt. </p>

<p> My lack of time management will negatively affect my learning as well as all other areas of my life. I tend to get bored easily if I can’t solve a problem for a period of time, or if the task is perceived to be too steep. My self-doubt affects my confidence in my ability to complete a task I am perfectly capable of doing. </p>

<p> My strengths are: Curiosity, empathy, compassion and open-mindedness. I could use these traits to my advantage by applying curiosity and open-mindedness to my learning, and using empathy and compassion to communicate with my cohorts, co-workers and clients. I am open and honest in my interaction with others and I believe it would be beneficial to my career in terms of creating positive relationships at work, which in turn would boost creativity and efficiency. </p>

<p> - Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>

<p> Curiosity helps me in my desire to understand new knowledge, but it can also hinder my work progress by driving me to fixate on issues that don’t need to be fixated on. Part of this also stems from my perfectionist streak(wanting to get everything perfect...when it’s the perfect moment to), thus creating procrastination. </p>

<p> - Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why. </p>

<p>No examples come to mind as of yet, but generally when I encounter tension, I prefer to address it before it gets out of hand. Reminding others of the same goal we’re trying to achieve, by actively listening to their point of view, respecting it whether I agree or not. And in turn, share my point of view without blame, judgement, or resentment. Focusing on the solution instead of the problem. </p>
