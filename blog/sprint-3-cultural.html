    <p> <strong> - What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></p>

        <p> 
            Emotional Intelligence is one’s ability to observe, regulate, and express one’s emotions in a healthy and constructive way. It is helpful to human interactions because it helps us empathise and relate to people despite different background and views. Humans are social animals and having the ability to read emotions and respond in kind helps us in connecting with others, whilst communicating what’s going on in our heads.

    <p> <strong> - How is it different to IQ?</strong></p>

        <p>
            IQ is, strictly speaking, inborn. IQ involves logical thinking. The ability to solve complex math or physics problems as opposed to relationship issues, is dependant on one’s effort in studying those subjects, as well as one’s inborn ability to reason and compute. Humans have advanced IQ in the sense that our reasoning and problem-solving capabilities are vastly superior to other species of animals.

    <p> <strong> - Why is it important?</strong></p>
    
         <p>
                Emotional intelligence is crucial in a person’s success in the workplace, social and family settings. It is the cornerstone of self-mastery and effective leadership, because people are influenced by emotions and having the ability to manage these emotions gives the individual a great advantage over those who cannot regulate their emotions as healthily and constructively. Fortunately for everyone it is a learned ability, because humans have the ability to learn through social cues and from observing others (such as family or friends). Using the science of neuroplasticity, we can actively change our brain pathways and neurons by focusing on what we give attention to. Overtime, the more we pay attention to positive beliefs about ourselves the more confident and happy we become. This in turn helps us become more competent in all areas of life.
