My Learning Plan (To be updated regularly)

My strengths: 

Curiosity, passion, empathy, 

My limitations: 

Tima management, discipline, focus, getting fixated and frustrated as a result

I will develop a system of time blocks. Chunking out time to do certain things, such as moving the course along by getting things done, time for exploration around things like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other knowledge gaps. And finally, time for relaxation. By following these blocks, I will eliminate panic and unnecessary time wasting.

I will seek help from my facilitators and peers, as I have. I will record my learning and find out how I can improve from day to day.

I expect the facilitation team to help me with my inquiries and encourage my learning. To be empathetic but also make me accountable.

To plan out time for extra-curriculars such as Toastmasters, personal relationships and time to unwind.

Week days are for learning and completing the course requirements. At least 8 hours will be allocated each day, with 5 minute breaks between every 15 minutes.
