    <p> <strong> - Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem. </strong></p>

        <p> 
          Where do I start? Getting stuck on the "Manipulating Objects" Javascript kata was one. I couldn't, for the life of me, find what was wrong with my code because it wouldn't run. Turned out, my other window was blocking the view, and I needed to place a comma where the window blocked my view.... It worked.
        </p>

    <p> <strong> - Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way. </strong></p>
        <p>
           Hasn't happened... yet. (Or not that I can recall right now)
        </p>>
        

    <p> <strong> - In both cases: </strong></p>

    <p> <strong> - What was the problem? </strong></p>
        <p>
           The problem was my panicked state, consuming my brain power and lessening my thinking abilities.
        </p>

    <p> <strong> - What problem solving techniques did you use? </strong></p>
    
         <p>
           Google, getting up to get some fresh air, and coming back to the problem. Asking peers helped, too.
        </p>

        <p> <strong> - How did you feel throughout the process? </strong></p>
    
         <p>
           Initial annoyance, panic, frustration, then finally, resolve or fed up enough to want to resolve things. Or I calm myself down enough to go through the steps one by one again.
        </p>

        <p> <strong> - What did you learn? </strong></p>
    
        
        <p>
          Being stressed is a constant state for me and I need to find a way to manage it. Because when I'm less stressed, I'm more able to solve a problem that may otherwise frustrate me.
       </p>
       
       <p> <strong> - Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process: </strong></p>

       <p> <strong> - Pseudocode </strong></p>

            <p>
                 Have not tried it
            </p>

       <p> <strong> - Trying something </strong></p>
            <p>
                 Many times, often times things don't work, but everytime I learn something new.
            </p>

       <p> <strong> - Rubber ducky method </strong></p>

            <p>
                 Have not tried it but maybe it will help me quite a bit, as going back to step-by-step methods have helped me in the past
            </p>

       <p> <strong> - Reading error messages </strong></p>
       
            <p>
               I'd like to be more proficient, it has helped me, but when I'm stressed, I can't discern the solutions as well as I can be.
            </p>


       <p> <strong> - Console.logging </strong></p>
       
            <p>
                 Still needs more work
            </p>


       <p> <strong> - Googling </strong></p>
       
            <p>
                 Fairly confident
            </p>


       <p> <strong> - Asking your peers for help </strong></p>
       
            <p>
                 Very confident
            </p>


       <p> <strong> - Asking coaches for help </strong></p>
       
            <p>
               I'd only ask if it's a problem I can't solve and been stuck for a while
            </p>


       <p> <strong> - Improving your process with reflection </strong></p>
       
            <p>
               Confident but needs more practice. Step-by-step formulas seem to work with my problem-solving style (when my mind isn't all over the place).
            </p>
